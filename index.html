        <h1>Toilet paper orientation</h1>
        <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p>Some toilet roll holders or dispensers allow the toilet paper to hang in front of (over) or behind (under) the roll when it is placed parallel to the wall. This sectionides opinions about which orientation is better. Arguments range from aesthetics, hospitality, ease of access, and cleanliness, to paper conservation, ease of detaching sheets, and compatibility with pets.</p>
        <p>This issue was the topic of a 1977 Ask Ann Landers column,[1] where it was occasionally reconsidered and often mentioned.[2][3][4][5] In a 1986 speech, Landers claimed it was the most popular column, attracting 15,000 letters.[6]</p>
        <p>The case study of "toilet paper orientation" has been used as a teaching tool in instructing sociology students in the practice of social constructionism.[7]</p>

        <h1>Arguments</h1>
        <p>The main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit.[8]</p>
        <p>The over position reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one's knuckles, potentially transferring grime and germs;[9] makes it easier to visually locate and to grasp the loose end;[10] gives the option to fold over the last sheet to show that the room has been cleaned;[11] and is generally the intended direction of viewing for the manufacturer's branding, so patterned toilet paper looks better this way.[12] </p>
        <p>The under position provides a more tidy appearance, in that the loose end can be more hidden from view;[13][14] reduces the risk of a toddler or a house pet such as a cat unrolling the toilet paper when batting at the roll;[15] and in a recreational vehicle may reduce unrolling during driving.[16] </p>
        <p>Partisans have claimed that each method makes it easier to tear the toilet paper on a perforated sheet boundary.[17] </p>
        <p>The over position is shown in illustrations with the first patents for a free-hanging toilet-roll holders, issued in 1891.[18] </p>
        <p>Various toilet paper dispensers are available which avoid the question of over or under orientation; for example, single sheet dispensers, jumbo roll dispensers in which the toilet roll is perpendicular to the wall, and twin roll dispensers.[19] Swivelling toilet paper dispensers have been developed which allow the paper to be unrolled in either direction.[20][21] </p>

        <h1>Public Opinion</h1>
        <p>In various surveys, around 70% of people prefer the over position.[a] In a survey of 1,000 Americans, Cottonelle found that "overs" are more likely than "unders" to notice a roll's direction (~75 percent), to be annoyed when the direction is "incorrect" (~25 percent), and to have flipped the direction at a friend's home (~30 percent).[citation needed] The same claim is made by James Buckley's The Bathroom Companion for people older than 50.[29] Toilet paper orientation is sometimes mentioned as a hurdle for married couples.[30] The issue may also arise in businesses and public places.[31] At the Amundsenâ€“Scott Research Station at the South Pole, complaints have been raised over which way to install toilet paper.[32] It is unclear if one orientation is more economical than the other. The Orange County Register attributes a claim to Planet Green that over saves on paper usage.[33] </p>
